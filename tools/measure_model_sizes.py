"""Measure the download size of everything SpeakLoop fetches.

The sizes in speakloop/models_info.py and speakloop/llama_server_fetch.py are
hardcoded on purpose: the installer names volumes BEFORE the user agrees to
download them, so it should not need a network round-trip first. This script is
how those hardcoded numbers get their values: run it once per pin change, paste
the block it prints, commit.

    python tools/measure_model_sizes.py

Nothing is downloaded. Hub repositories are measured through the Hugging Face
metadata API and llama.cpp release assets through HTTP HEAD requests, so the
whole run costs a few kilobytes.

Two properties of the measurement matter, both of them reasons not to eyeball
these numbers:

* a repo is measured WHOLE. snapshot_download without allow_patterns fetches
  every file, and a repo may ship several weight formats side by side, so the
  download can be larger than the weights the app ends up loading;
* sizes are decimal MB (bytes / 1_000_000), matching how downloads are
  advertised and what models_info.size_mb is documented to mean.

Supertonic is the one entry measured on disk rather than over the wire. Its
upstream repo is Supertone/supertonic-3 (named in the README), but what the
supertonic package actually pulls out of it is the package's business, not ours,
so the repo total would be an upper bound rather than the download. The cache
directory is the download: the package writes with local_dir=, which puts files
down directly instead of through the hub's blob/symlink layout. The cost is that
the model has to be present already.
