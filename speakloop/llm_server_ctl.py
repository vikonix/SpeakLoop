"""Lifecycle control for the local LLM server subprocess.

Used with the "llama-server" backend, the only one that runs a server of its
own: the controller launches the official llama.cpp binary, waits until it
answers, and terminates it on app shutdown. The dialogue itself goes through
LLMManager (llm.py).

The server speaks the same OpenAI-compatible API as LM Studio and answers 503
while the model is still loading, so the readiness poll is just
LLMManager.check_connection against config.LLM_SERVER_URL.
