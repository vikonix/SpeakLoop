"""Where SpeakLoop's files live - the single answer for the whole project.

Two roots, deliberately separate, because the same tree serves two purposes
that only coincide when the app runs from a clone:

* :func:`data_root` - everything written on the user's machine: settings,
  themes they add, downloaded models, the llama-server binary, logs. Running
  from the repository this is the repository; installed as a package it is the
  OS user-data directory, because a package's own directory belongs to the tool
  that installed it (a reinstall or an upgrade can rebuild that environment,
  which would carry off both the downloads and settings.json).
* :func:`shipped_root` - files that ship WITH the code and are only read, inside
  this package: the built-in theme schemas and the lesson prompt. They live
  inside the package rather than at the top of the source tree for one reason -
  a wheel carries only what belongs to a package, and a directory at the root
  of the tree belongs to no package and is simply absent from an installed
  copy.

Conflating the two is the bug this module exists to prevent: one root answering
both questions cannot move to the user-data directory without sending the app
looking for committed resources in a directory that only ever holds downloads.

The layout inside :func:`data_root` is identical in both modes on purpose. It
means instructions, paths printed in logs and advice in error messages read the
same everywhere, and a user can carry the directory from one machine to
another.

**Only the standard library may be imported here.** ``install.py`` reads this
module before the requirements are installed, which rules out ``platformdirs``
and makes the three OS branches worth writing by hand. The same rule (and the
same reason) as ``speakloop/models_info.py``: modules forbidden to import
``config`` - the three fetchers and the hardware detector - may import this one.
