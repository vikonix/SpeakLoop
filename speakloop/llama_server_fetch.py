"""Download and install the official llama-server binary into bin/llama/.

Standalone helper for the default "llama-server" LLM backend: it fetches a
PINNED llama.cpp release from GitHub, checks the sha256 of every asset,
unpacks them into bin/llama/, and confirms that the installed binary really
runs with the backend it advertises.

Callers: install.py (its LLM-stack step) and - for the read-only parts -
speakloop/config.py, speakloop/llm_server_ctl.py and
speakloop/detect_hardware.py.

Run it directly:

    python -m speakloop.llama_server_fetch              # auto-detect the variant
    python -m speakloop.llama_server_fetch --list       # show known variants
    python -m speakloop.llama_server_fetch --variant win-cpu-x64 --force
    python -m speakloop.llama_server_fetch --dry-run    # print the plan only

Design notes
------------
* Standard library only, and no side effects at import time. The module is
  meant to be callable from install.py *before* the project requirements are
  installed, and later from the running app, so it must not pull in requests,
  tqdm or huggingface_hub.
* The release tag is pinned in RELEASE_TAG and every asset carries the sha256
  published on the release page. Moving to a newer llama.cpp build is a
  deliberate commit that updates both, never a silent "latest".
* CUDA correctness is verified rather than assumed. A llama.cpp CUDA build
  whose cudart/cublas DLLs are missing or of the wrong major version falls
  back to CPU *silently*: it still logs "offloaded N/N layers to GPU" and the
  app keeps working, just about three times slower. `--list-devices` is the
  cheap explicit check that catches it.
* A GPU variant may name a `fallback` variant, and only a failed device check
  triggers it. That is how Linux copes with a GPU backend whose availability
  cannot be established before the download (Vulkan needs a loader, an ICD and
  a device the driver publishes through them). The substitution is logged with
  the reason and recorded in the stamp, so it stays the opposite of the silent
  CPU fallback above: visible, and visible afterwards. "Afterwards" means the
  stamp specifically - the log lives one session, because setup_logging
  truncates main.log on a fresh launch - and it is also what stops the GPU
  build from being downloaded again on every run: is_current() accepts a
  recorded substitution as the answer for the variant that was asked for.
  An explicit `--variant` (or `--force`) is how that answer is reconsidered.
* The install is staged: assets are unpacked into bin/llama.new/ and only
  swapped onto bin/llama/ once every archive is verified, so an interrupted
  run cannot leave a half-written installation behind. The stamp file that
  marks the install as complete is written last, after verification, so a
  binary that fails its checks is always re-installed on the next run.

    min_driver_cuda: lowest CUDA version the NVIDIA driver must report for this

    device_pattern: regex that must match `llama-server --list-devices` output
        after the install, or None when the build has no GPU backend to check.
    backend: the compute backend this build was compiled with ("CUDA",
        "Vulkan", "Metal", "CPU"), stated rather than inferred. Do not derive it
        anywhere else - from the platform, from the variant's name prefix - as
        every such derivation is a guess that a new row in this table can
        silently invalidate. "CPU" holds exactly when device_pattern is None.
    fallback: variant to install instead when this one passes its download and
        --version checks but fails the device check, or None to make that
        failure final. It is a property of the build rather than of whoever
        picked it: the same missing GPU backend has the same remedy whether the
        variant came from select_variant() or from an explicit --variant.
    min_macos: lowest macOS version that can load this build, or None when the
        question does not arise (every non-Apple row). It is a property of the
        published asset, not of macOS: it is the `minos` field of the binary's
        LC_BUILD_VERSION load command, which llama.cpp's CI stamps from
        CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET when the workflow sets one and from the
        runner's own macOS version when it does not. Hence its place here,
        beside the sha256 and the size: all three describe the same file of the
        same pinned release, and bumping RELEASE_TAG has to re-snap them
        together. Read it with
        `llvm-objdump --macho --private-headers llama-server`.

        Only select_variant() consults it, exactly like min_driver_cuda: an

    cheap. Raises LlamaServerFetchError on any failure; on success the returned
    path is a binary that has been run at least once and reported the expected
    build and backend.

    A variant whose GPU backend brings up no device is retried with its
    ``fallback`` (see Variant), which is how a machine with no usable Vulkan
    still ends up with a working CPU build instead of a failed install. Only
    the device check is retried, and only downwards: every other failure is
    raised as it happens, and the chain is finite because a variant is never
    tried twice. The variant asked for is written into the stamp together with
    the reason, so the next call can tell "the GPU build is not
    installed" from "the GPU build was tried and this is what came of it".

    *reconsider* asks for a recorded substitution to be ignored, so the GPU
    build is downloaded and device-checked again. The CLI sets it when the user
    named ``--variant`` by hand, because the reason anyone does that is usually
    that they have changed the machine the earlier decision was made on. It is
    deliberately NOT inferred from ``variant`` being non-None: install.py
    resolves the variant early to name the download size in its prompt, and
