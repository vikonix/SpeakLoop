"""Command line entry point: everything that must happen before the app loads.

This module is what ``[project.scripts]`` points at, and it exists because of
one ordering constraint. Importing ``speakloop.app`` pulls in torch,
faster-whisper and Kokoro, which takes many seconds on a slow machine, while
``--version`` should answer instantly - so the import has to happen AFTER
argument parsing, which means the parsing cannot live in the module being
imported.

The same constraint applies to ``bootstrap.early_init()``: the UTF-8 console
setup and the library warning filters only take effect if they run before the
libraries are imported.

**Only the standard library may be imported at module level here** (plus
``speakloop.bootstrap``, which is stdlib-only itself, and ``speakloop.__init__``,
which defines nothing but ``__version__``). Anything heavier would defeat the
purpose of the module.

Three launch forms reach :func:`main`, and all three behave identically:

* ``speakloop`` - the console script, which calls it directly;
* ``python -m speakloop`` - via ``speakloop/__main__.py``;
* ``python main.py`` - via the shim in the project root.

``--detect-hardware`` lives here for a reason of the same shape: an installed
package's environment is not always reachable with ``python -m``, so a
maintenance command that only existed as a module could not be run by the
people who need it most. The console script is the entry an installed package
puts on PATH.
