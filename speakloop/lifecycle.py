The controller keeps the orchestration (quit_app, which releases the app's own

    the OS level without running any DLL detach handlers, so that crash

    Three launch forms reach the same code, and they need three different
    commands. Prepending sys.executable to sys.argv is right for exactly one
    of them:

    * ``python main.py`` (and any direct script path): sys.argv[0] is a .py
      file, so the interpreter goes in front, as before.
    * ``python -m speakloop``: sys.argv[0] is the full path to __main__.py, and
      running that file directly is NOT equivalent - executing a file puts its
      own directory on sys.path instead of the current one, so ``import
      speakloop`` would fail from a source checkout. The launch is reconstructed
      as ``-m`` against the package the main module came from.
    * the ``speakloop`` console script: sys.argv[0] is the script itself
      (``Scripts\\speakloop.exe`` on Windows, a shebang file on POSIX), which
      knows how to start the interpreter on its own. Putting sys.executable in
      front would produce ``python.exe speakloop.exe``, which does not run at all.

    The console-script case is the one that fails silently until a package
    exists, which is why the test is written the other way round: the
    interpreter is prepended only for something that is recognisably a Python
    source file, and anything else is assumed to be self-executing.

    #
    # The name test is load-bearing, not defensive. A Windows console script is
    # a launcher with a zip archive appended, whose __main__.py is imported
    # through the normal machinery - so __spec__ exists and is named literally
    # "__main__". Reading that as a module yields `python.exe -m __main__`, a
    # command that does not run, and the app closes instead of restarting.

    subprocess.Popen is used instead of os.execv: on Windows execv detaches
    the console under some launchers and mangles arguments with spaces.

    The replacement must not share the dying parent's console/stdio: when
    launched from an IDE, the IDE closes those pipes as soon as the parent
    exits and the child's first print would crash with [Errno 22] (the same
    failure mode bootstrap.early_init describes for os.execv). So
    stdio is pointed at DEVNULL - the app logs to logs/main.log anyway -
    and on Windows the child is detached from the console and, when the
    launcher allows it, broken out of the IDE's job object so "stop" in the
    IDE cannot kill the restarted app.
