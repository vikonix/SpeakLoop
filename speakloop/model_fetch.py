"""Download the models SpeakLoop always needs into model_cache/.

Covers the downloads that are required whatever the LLM backend is: the
faster-whisper speech recognizer and Kokoro TTS - both through the Hugging
Face hub cache - plus the Supertonic 3 TTS weights, which live in their own
cache directory.

The LLM stack is deliberately NOT here: `speakloop/llama_server_fetch.py`
fetches the llama-server binary and `speakloop/gguf_fetch.py` the GGUF chat
model. Both are unnecessary when `llm_backend` is "lm-studio", while
everything in this module is needed by every run that speaks and listens, so
the split follows what a run can actually skip.

Run it directly:

    python -m speakloop.model_fetch              # everything that is missing
    python -m speakloop.model_fetch --list       # what is present, what is not
    python -m speakloop.model_fetch --hf --force # re-fetch the hub repos only

Design notes
------------
* No side effects at import time and no heavy imports at module level:
  huggingface_hub and supertonic are imported inside the functions that need
  them, so install.py can import this module before the requirements step has
  run and still get the "is it downloaded?" predicates. The two project modules
  imported at the top, models_info and loader, are pure and stdlib-only, so
  they cost nothing and break no rule.
* This module must NEVER import speakloop.config. config sets HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 as
  soon as the models are cached, which would switch the network off exactly
  when a download is wanted. The dependency runs the other way: config takes
  the cache paths and the Supertonic predicate from here.
* What each model IS (repo id, label, download size) comes from
  speakloop/models_info.py, which config reads as well - that is how the same
  facts reach both sides without either importing the other. It is pure data
  with no imports of its own, so it costs this module nothing. Paths stay here,
  next to the code that writes into them.
* prepare_hf_env() must run before huggingface_hub is first imported anywhere
  in the process - HF_HOME, HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET and HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS are
  read at import time. Each ensure_* function calls it, so callers do not have
  to remember the ordering.

    The hub cache stores each file once as blobs/<sha> and points
    snapshots/<revision>/<name> at it with a symlink. Creating a symlink on
    Windows needs Developer Mode or admin rights; without either, os.symlink
    raises OSError [WinError 1314].

    huggingface_hub has a fallback for that (move or copy the blob into the
    snapshot instead), but it is gated on are_symlinks_supported(), which is NOT
    thread safe: it writes True into its per-directory cache BEFORE running the
    probe that may overwrite it with False. snapshot_download uses eight worker
    threads and its file lock is per-etag, so a second file that reaches the
    linking step inside that window reads the optimistic True, calls os.symlink
    and gets 1314 - which _create_symlink does not catch (it handles
    FileExistsError and PermissionError, and 1314 maps to EINVAL, so it arrives
    as a bare OSError). The failure therefore lands on whichever small file
    happened to race, while the large weights download fine.

    HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS is the deterministic way out: are_symlinks_supported
    returns False on it BEFORE consulting the racy cache, so every file takes
    the copy path. It is set only when our own probe says symlinks are
    unavailable, so a machine with Developer Mode keeps the cheaper symlinked
    cache. Windows-only: macOS and Linux create symlinks without a permission
    bit to fight, so there is nothing here for either to fall back from.

    HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET stays on for every Windows run because older hf-xet
    downloaders linked files into the cache themselves and raised 1314 with no
    copy fallback at all. macOS gets the same variable set for an unrelated
    reason - see the early return below - so this module ends up disabling Xet
    everywhere except Linux, where it downloads and reports progress correctly
    (confirmed under WSL2). It stays enabled there rather than disabled
    everywhere on principle, because Xet is otherwise the faster transport.

    All three variables are frozen by huggingface_hub's constants.py at import
    time, so this must run before huggingface_hub is first imported anywhere in
    the process. The env vars are re-applied on every call (they are cheap, and
    a caller that restored os.environ must not silently lose them), while the
