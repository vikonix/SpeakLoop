"""Download the GGUF chat model the llama-server backend runs.

Second half of the LLM stack: speakloop/llama_server_fetch.py fetches the
binary, this module fetches the weights it loads. Both are unnecessary when
`llm_backend` is "lm-studio" (LM Studio manages its own model), which is why
they live apart from speakloop/model_fetch.py - the speech models there are
always needed.

Run it directly:

    python -m speakloop.gguf_fetch              # download if missing
    python -m speakloop.gguf_fetch --list       # show target path and state
    python -m speakloop.gguf_fetch --force      # download even if present
    python -m speakloop.gguf_fetch --fallback   # the fallback model instead

Design notes
------------
* Same import discipline as model_fetch: no side effects at import time and
  huggingface_hub imported inside the functions, so install.py can import this
  module before the requirements step has run.
* This module must NEVER import speakloop.config, for the same reason model_fetch
  must not: config flips HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 once the models are cached.
* It deliberately does NOT resolve settings.json's "external_model_path". Doing
  so would mean reading the user config, which is exactly the dependency the
  point above forbids. The default target matches config.EXTERNAL_MODEL_PATH's
  own default, and a caller that wants to honour an overridden path passes it
  as *target*.
* The fallback model (models_info.GGUF_CHAT_FALLBACK) is fetched only on
  request. The installer asks for the main model alone, because the fallback
  is useful only to an owner who has measured that the main one is too slow.
