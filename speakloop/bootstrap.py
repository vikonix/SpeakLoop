"""Early process setup for the SpeakLoop entry point.

Two phases, split because they bracket the heavy imports in app.py:

  * ``early_init()`` must run BEFORE the heavy speakloop.* imports (torch,
    transformers, Kokoro, faster-whisper): it sets the UTF-8 environment
    hints, switches the console streams to UTF-8, and installs the library
    warning filters.
  * ``setup_logging()`` must run AFTER those imports: basicConfig with
    force=True replaces any handlers auto-installed by logging calls during
    the imports, which would otherwise turn basicConfig into a silent no-op
    and leave main.log empty.

``open_log_section()`` belongs to neither phase: it writes the run header into
one handler's file, for the append-only logs such as the hardware probe's.

Only stdlib imports here, so ``from speakloop import bootstrap`` stays free
and can precede everything heavy.
