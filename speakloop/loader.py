"""Configuration loading machinery - pure, stateless helpers.

This module holds the *mechanics* of building SpeakLoop's configuration: reading
JSON files, validating individual settings, creating directories, probing the
cache and the compute device. None of it runs at import time and none of it
keeps global state - every function takes what it needs as arguments and returns
a value. That keeps the rules (range checks, type checks, fallbacks) unit-testable
in isolation, without a filesystem or the heavy ML stack.

The actual configuration values live in ``config.py``, which calls these
functions at import time to build its constants. Validation problems are reported
to stderr (never raised) so a hand-edited settings.json cannot crash startup;
``config.py`` decides what to do with the returned fallback.
