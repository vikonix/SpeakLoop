"""Launcher for a source checkout: ``python main.py``.

The application itself lives in ``speakloop/app.py`` and the argument handling
in ``speakloop/cli.py``; this file is the third way into the same
``cli.main()``, alongside the ``speakloop`` console script and
``python -m speakloop``.

It stays in the project root, and stays this thin, for two separate reasons.
Thin, because the application may not live here: a package module named
``main`` would claim that import name in site-packages for every package in the
environment, which is why the code belongs in ``speakloop/app.py``. In the
root, because ``python main.py`` is what the README, AGENTS.md, ``install.py``
and ``run_speakloop.bat`` all tell people to run, and the file is not part of
the package anyway - package discovery only collects ``speakloop*``.

Nothing may be imported here beyond the line below. Anything heavier would run
before ``cli.main()`` parses the arguments, which is the ordering the split
exists to protect.
