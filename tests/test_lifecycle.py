"""Unit tests for the relaunch command (speakloop/lifecycle.py).

An in-session restart of the application goes through
``spawn_replacement()``. What it must reconstruct is not "a command
that starts SpeakLoop" but "the command that started THIS process", and that
differs by launch form:

* ``python main.py`` needs the interpreter in front;
* ``python -m speakloop`` needs ``-m`` again, because executing __main__.py as a
  file path puts the package's own directory on sys.path instead of the
  project root;
* the ``speakloop`` console script must be re-run on its own, since prepending
  the interpreter yields ``python.exe speakloop.exe``.

Only the first form is observable on a machine running from a checkout, and
the third one exists only where the package is installed - which is exactly
why it is stubbed here rather than left to be discovered later.

The stubbing has to be right to be worth anything, and the tempting stub is
wrong: a Windows console script does NOT carry ``__spec__ = None``. The .exe is
a launcher with a zip archive appended, and the __main__.py inside it is
imported like any module, so its spec exists and is named ``"__main__"``. Read
as a module name that gives ``python.exe -m __main__``, a command that does not
run, and the application closes instead of restarting. Both halves are pinned
below.

Run from the project root with:
