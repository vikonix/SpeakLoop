"""Unit tests for the llama-server downloader (speakloop/llama_server_fetch.py).

What can be checked without the machine the build is for: which variant this
platform resolves to, how a binary that dies on startup is reported, and the
shape of the pinned macOS rows. Everything that would reach the network, the
disk or a subprocess is stubbed, so the whole file runs on any OS.

The macOS rows are the reason this file exists. They were added from the
release page and the llama.cpp sources rather than from a Mac, so the facts
that a Mac would have confirmed are written down here instead: that Apple
Silicon resolves to the Metal build even under Rosetta 2, that the Metal device
pattern matches what --list-devices is expected to print, and that no macOS
asset is a .zip - zipfile drops the unix mode bits, which would unpack a
llama-server nobody can execute (see _extract).

Run from the project root with:

    python -m unittest tests.test_llama_server_fetch
