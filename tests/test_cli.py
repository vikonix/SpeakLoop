"""Unit tests for the command line entry point (speakloop/cli.py).

One property, worth a file of its own: **`speakloop --version` must answer without
loading the application.** Printing a version string is the first thing a bug
report asks for, and on a slow machine importing speakloop.app - torch,
faster-whisper, Kokoro - is tens of seconds. That is the entire reason cli.py
exists as a separate module: `bootstrap.early_init()` only works before the
libraries it configures are imported, and argument parsing cannot live in the
module it is meant to protect.

Which makes `from speakloop import app`, sitting inside `main()` rather than at the
top of the file, load-bearing rather than a matter of style - and a one-line
edit away from being wrong. Moving it up breaks nothing visibly: every launch
form still works, `--version` still prints, it just takes ten seconds first. So
the test below reads cli.py's module-level imports and says so out loud, and two
behavioural tests pin the order around them.

A second property lives here because it belongs to the same entry point: the
two native pieces no wheel can supply - tkinter and PortAudio - must fail with
the command that installs them rather than with a traceback, and everything
else must keep its traceback. `install.py` checks both before the first launch,
but a manual install (`pip install -e .`) never runs it.
