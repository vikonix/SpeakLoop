"""Unit tests for the model catalogue (speakloop/models_info.py).

The sizes themselves cannot be checked here - that needs the network, and
tools/measure_model_sizes.py is where it happens. What CAN be checked without a
network is that nobody added a model or a release asset and left its size out,
which is the failure this module exists to prevent: a missing number does not
crash anything, it just makes the installer's prompts and the progress output
quietly wrong.

The same applies to the other fields of llama_server_fetch.VARIANTS, whose
rows are checked here for internal consistency (backend against device check,
fallback against the table) for the same reason: an inconsistent row does not
fail loudly, it makes the module describe a build as something it is not.

Run from the project root with:

    python -m unittest tests.test_models_info
