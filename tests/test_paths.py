"""Unit tests for the path resolution (speakloop/paths.py).

This module decides where every file the app touches lives, and it answers
differently depending on how SpeakLoop was installed. Only one of those answers -
the source tree - is observable on the machine these tests run on, so the
package branch is exercised by stubbing the repository marker and the platform,
which is also the only way to check all three operating systems from one.

What is worth pinning here, in order of what would hurt most if it broke:

* the roots stay separate (a package's downloads must not be looked for among
  its code, and its shipped resources must not be looked for among the
  downloads);
* the shipped resources sit INSIDE the package, because that is the only place
  a wheel carries a non-Python file from - a directory at the top of the source
  tree is skipped by both the build and the install without a word;
* SPEAKLOOP_HOME wins over both modes, since it is the documented way out of
  every wrong automatic answer;
* the marker is the file next to the package, not a "site-packages" test on
  __file__, because that one misreports editable installs;
* the layout under the root is the same in both modes, which is what lets one
  set of instructions describe both.

Nothing here touches the filesystem except through tmp_path-style stubs. Run
from the project root with:
