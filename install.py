"""SpeakLoop installer.

A standalone, idempotent setup helper that walks through everything needed to
run SpeakLoop on a fresh machine:

  1. Verify the Python version.
  2. Detect an NVIDIA GPU / CUDA version (via nvidia-smi, no extra packages).
  3. (GPU only) install torch as a CUDA build.
  4. pip install the project dependencies (read from pyproject.toml).
  5. Pre-download the Hugging Face models (faster-whisper small, Kokoro) into
     model_cache/.
  6. Pre-download the Supertonic 3 TTS model into model_cache/supertonic3/
     (the Spanish TTS backend; kept outside the HF hub cache because the
     supertonic package uses its own cache directory).
  7. Install the pinned llama-server binary into bin/llama/.
  8. Download the GGUF chat model into models/.
  9. Run `python -m speakloop.detect_hardware` to write
     config/hardware_config.json.
 10. Write run_speakloop.bat / run_speakloop.sh: a one-click launcher that
     runs main.py with the project's virtual environment.

Design notes
------------
* Every step prints exactly what it will do (including the precise command)
  and asks for confirmation before running. Answer Y to run, n to abort the
  whole installer, or s to skip just that step. Use --yes to auto-confirm and
  --dry-run to print the steps without executing anything.
* If a step's target is already installed/present, the installer does NOT
  silently redo it: it says so and asks reinstall vs. skip (defaulting to
  skip). Under --yes such steps are skipped unless --reinstall is also given.
* Nothing that can be downloaded is downloaded by this script itself: the
  three fetchers live in the package (speakloop/model_fetch.py,
  speakloop/gguf_fetch.py, speakloop/llama_server_fetch.py) and the steps
  below are thin wrappers around them, so the fetchers can also run on their
  own (`python -m speakloop.model_fetch` and so on). Their log output is
  bridged into logs/install.log (see _LogBridge).
* The spaCy pipeline Kokoro's English G2P needs is NOT installed here: misaki
  downloads it with pip at the first English synthesis.
* GPU detection deliberately relies only on `nvidia-smi`, because
  speakloop/detect_hardware.py imports torch (which may not be installed yet) -
  a classic bootstrap chicken-and-egg. The probe is run at the very end, once
  those packages exist.
* The dependency list is read from `[project.dependencies]` in pyproject.toml
  rather than from a requirements.txt, so the project states its dependencies
  once.
* The CUDA torch wheels are installed before the dependency step so that the
  `torch` constraint is already satisfied - otherwise pip would pull the CPU
  build from PyPI only for it to be replaced afterwards.
* Packages install into the interpreter that runs this script (sys.executable);
  the script does not create a venv. It checks up front whether it is inside a
  virtual environment and, if not, warns and asks before installing globally
  (and refuses outright under --yes). Activate the project's .venv first.
* The whole run is mirrored to logs/install.log.

Run:  python install.py            (interactive)
      python install.py --yes      (no prompts)
      python install.py --dry-run  (preview only)
      python install.py --cpu      (skip all GPU-specific installs)
